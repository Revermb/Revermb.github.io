            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>First, make sure to have a bootable drive (in my case debian)</p>
            <p>Continue doing a standard setup, make sure ssh is enabled</p>

            <h2>Making it a Static IP</h2>
            <p>Do "<code>sudo nano /etc/networks/interfaces</code>" and add the following:</p>
            <p><code>{wifi interface} auto <br>
                iface {wifi interface} inet static <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address {desired ip address}<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;netmask {desired ip netmask}<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gateway {desired ip gateway}<br>
            </code></p>
            <p>Replace {wifi interface} with the wifi interface you get by doing "<code>ip addr</code>"</p>

            <h3>Adding rdp</h3>
            <p>This RDP is ONLY for in your local network and is unencrypted (since i am too lazy to do anything with
                TSL)</p>
            <p>Install the following packages</p>
            <code>sudo apt-get install -y Xorg</code>

            <h3>Adding an external drive</h3>
            <p>Open your fstab file "<code>sudo nano /etc/fstab</code>"</p>
            <p>We will mount our drive to folder inside our home folder</p>
