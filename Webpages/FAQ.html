            <h3>Why "Revermb"?</h3>
            <p>Well, my username used to be just Reverb, but since that was a rather common username. I decided to
                switch it up a
                bit.</p>
            <p>This is now also my preffered username as it combines my first name &amp; surname into one &plus; an
                audio term</p>
            <p>Re &rarr; first 2 letters of my first name</p>
            <p>Verm &rarr; first 4 letters of my surname</p>
            <p>b &rarr; additional charachter to make it sound like reverb</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>I have a classical music singing degree, which legally allows me to be recognised as a musician. I
                don't
                do much with it though since i just got it as a hobby.</p>

        <h2>Site specific</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Why/How did you create this site?</h3>
            <p>This actually was a practice site i made back in 2023 to practice my html and bootstrap css, I still
                do
                it mainly here but I also wanted a place i can direct viewers to if they have any questions. That's
                why
                I made this site</p>
            <p>As to how: This site is running on github pages, and was created with visual studio code (my main
                text/code editor)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why does the site look like that???</h3>
            <p>I prefer to make my own things from scratch, this can create good or bad things. I think this site
                is a combination of both</p>
            <p>besides, i try my best to stay w3c compliant</p>
            <p>(keyword is <span class="Bold italiced">TRY</span> XD)</p>
