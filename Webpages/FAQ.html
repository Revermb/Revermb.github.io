            <h2>Why "Revermb"?</h2>
            <p>Well, my username used to be just Reverb, but since that was a rather common username. I decided to
                switch it up a
                bit.</p>

            <h2>Why/How did you create this site?</h2>
            <p>This actually was a practice site i made back in 2023 to practice my html and bootstrap css, I still do
                it mainly here but I also wanted a place i can direct viewers to if they have any questions. That's why
                I made this site</p>
            <p>As to how: This site is running on github pages, and was created with visual studio code (my main
                text/code editor)</p>
