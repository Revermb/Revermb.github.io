            <h2>Rule breaking messages</h2>
            <p>Anything that breaks the explicitely mentioned behavior in <span class="Bold Italic">rules</span> can be
                given a warn</p>
            <p>a warn can be given by doing <span>"/warn [username] [reason]"</span></p>
            <p>The warned user will get a DM by our bot <a href="https://juniper.bot">juniper.bot</a> with the reason
                and for how long the warn lasts (standard is 14 days)</p>
            <p>if you aren't sure if a message is accountable for a warn, you can ask other moderators for their
                oppinion, if they agree then proceed with the warn</p>
            <p>Warns given via this method will automatically apply the punishment that is associated with that same
                amount of warns</p>

            <h2>bots</h2>
            <p>Since the server has automod and Juniper both as moderation, a lot of the work will be done by them as
                you
                can see
                here</p>

            <p>Users trying to bypass this filter are most likely up to no good and if they do, a sufficient consuquence
                is to warn them</p>

            <h2>Gray areas</h2>
            <p>Most images are fine on the server, most of the audience is 18+ and so ecchi images are okay</p>
